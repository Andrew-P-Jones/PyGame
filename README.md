## Overview

**Project Title**: Pygame Project

**Project Description**: Learning how to use the Pygame library in Python to create a game. Buliding Pong and then Tetris

**Project Goals**: Learn more about OOP and how to use Pygame, and work on creative solutions for software design.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python 3
2. Pip install Pygame
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is located
4. Run the command 'python3 pong.py' or 'python3 tetris.py' to start the game

Instructions for using the software:
Pong:
1. Use the w and s keys to move the left paddle up and down
2. Use the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down
3. Play the game until one player reaches a score of 5, after which the game will display the winner and restart the game
4. To exit the game, click the close button on the window

Teteris:
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the tetromino left and right
2. Thats all for now as the game is still in development


## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python 3.12.6
* Pygame 2.6.1

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Pygame Docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [Pong Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U)
* [Learn more about OOP in python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Finish the function for generating the velocity vectors of the balls in pong so that it is fully modular based on the inputed number of sections per paddle
* [ ] Finsh building out the tertris classes and methods so that the game loop and be finished
* [ ] Finishing touches on tetris such as the game over screen and the ability to restart the game
